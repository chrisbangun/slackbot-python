# slackbot-python

This repo consists of two main folders:
1. mongobot --> contains the main logic of commands to be executed by the Bot
2. slackbot --> contains codes that made the bot "alive"

Most part of the code in slacbot are mainly taken from https://github.com/lins05/slackbot. You can refer to that link in order to install slackbot in your machine.
